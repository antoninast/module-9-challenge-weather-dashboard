## Description
The Weather Dashboard website provides an intuitive platform for users to check the weather forecast for any city. By simply entering the name of the city in the search field, users will be able to view the current weather conditions as well as the forecast for the next five days, ensuring they have all the information they need for planning ahead.

In addition, the website automatically stores the cities you search for in your search history, allowing for quick and convenient access to previously checked locations. If you no longer wish to keep a particular city in your history, you have the option to delete it, ensuring your search history remains relevant and streamlined. This feature makes it easier to manage and navigate between multiple cities without the need to re-enter their names each time.

1. Enter the name of the city to view the weather forecast.
